  - Hi sweetie!
  - Congrats on moving out of college!
  - I heard your new house is still unfurnished.
  - And I know you are in a lot of debt right now...
  - And I mean a lot of debt... Like big debt...
  - Lots of debt indeed :D
  - But worry not! There's a big sale on 'Ama-zoom' right now!
  - I sent you a list of furniture items you may need. You should try to grab them
    before the sale ends.
  - I hear they even let you pick sizes!
  - Anyway, best of luck buying everything honey!
  - Do hurry up though. The sale ends in 1 minute :D
