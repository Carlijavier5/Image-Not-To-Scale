  - HONEY!
  - I've beem scrolling through the 'Ama-Zoom' sale and there really are so many
    items a new homeowner like you could use.
  - PLUS IT'S ALL DIRT CHEAP.
  - I know you've always had a hard time making choices by yourself...
  - I mean, there's a reason I helped you pick your outfits all the way up to the
    10th grade,
  - So, I decided to add some items to your shopping list that I think would help
    you out a ton!
  - You should really get a move on though darling.
  - The sale ends in X minutes so GO GO GO.
  - . . .
  - Oh, the items are cheap becuse they're coming from some places overseas.
  - I hope you remeber your unit conversions from grade school! :D
